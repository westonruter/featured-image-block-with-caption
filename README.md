## Description ##

This plugin adds the ability to show a caption in the Featured Image block via the same "Add caption" block toolbar button available on the Image block. Image captions must be edited in the Media Library.

This is a prototype to implement [gutenberg#40946](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40946).
